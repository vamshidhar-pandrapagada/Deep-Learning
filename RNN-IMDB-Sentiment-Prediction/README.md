## Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks
Implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. 
Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the sequence of words. 

In this project we use a dataset of IMDB movie reviews, accompanied by labels.
