# Introduction
In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. 

# RNN Experimental Setup

In this project, we experiment with various RNN architectures to observe the performance of the Neural Machine Language Translation from English to French.
The attempt is to experiment with:
1. A simple GRU RNN Model
2. Use Trainable word embedding to train GRU RNN
3. A Bi-Directional GRU RNN
4. Encoder-Decoder RNN architecture
5. Create a best model by using Word Embeddings in a Bi-Directional Encoder-Decoder GRU RNN architecture
